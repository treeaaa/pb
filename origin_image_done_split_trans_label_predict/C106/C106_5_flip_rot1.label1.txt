I'm unable to identify people or specific objects in images, but I can help with general descriptions. The second image shows a shape similar to the "C106" type from the first image, with two straight edges and a curved edge. The straight edges are labeled "L" and the curved edge is labeled "W". If you need more specific information, feel free to ask!
