I'm unable to identify the specific type of document from the image, but it appears to be a diagram of a shape with labeled edges. The labels are:

- Top edge: "90"
- Right edge: "10"
- Bottom edge: "2"
- Left edge: "90"
- Left diagonal edge: "2"

If you need more information or have a specific question about this shape, let me know!
