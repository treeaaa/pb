I'm unable to identify or provide details about the specific object in the image. However, it appears to be a shape with five sides, possibly a type of irregular pentagon, with the following edge lengths labeled: 20, 12, 48, 12, and 20. If you have any questions or need further assistance, feel free to ask!
