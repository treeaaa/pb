I'm unable to identify or provide information about specific individuals in images. However, I can help with a description of the shape. The image shows a pentagon with the following side lengths:

- One side is 51 units
- Another side is 35 units
- Another side is 19 units
- Another side is 48 units
- Another side is 24 units

If you need further assistance, feel free to ask!
