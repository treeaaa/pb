The image appears to be a simple diagram of a rectangular shape with labels on each side. The labels are as follows:

- One side is labeled "C445"
- The opposite side is labeled "C445"
- Another side is labeled "C446"
- The opposite side is labeled "C446"

This seems to represent a rectangular object or area with specific identifiers for each side.
