I'm unable to identify or provide information about specific individuals or objects in images. However, I can help with a description of the shape. The image shows a C-shaped profile with the following edge lengths:

- One edge is 41 units.
- The next edge is 30 units.
- The next edge is 58 units.
- The next edge is 30 units.
- The final edge is 22 units.

If you need further assistance, feel free to ask!
